  "title": "How Does Agentic AI Work?",
  "description": "Agentic AI uses a four-step process for problem-solving: Perceive, Reason, Act, and Learn. It leverages large language models, RAG, and external tools to automate tasks and improve decision-making.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "name": "Perceive",
      "description": "AI agents gather and process data from various sources, such as sensors, databases, and digital interfaces. This involves extracting meaningful features, recognizing objects, or identifying relevant entities in the environment."
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "name": "Reason",
      "description": "A large language model acts as the orchestrator, or reasoning engine, that understands tasks, generates solutions, and coordinates specialized models for specific functions like content creation, visual processing, or recommendation systems. This step uses techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to access proprietary data sources and deliver accurate, relevant outputs."
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "name": "Act",
      "description": "By integrating with external tools and software via application programming interfaces, agentic AI can quickly execute tasks based on the plans it has formulated. Guardrails can be built into AI agents to help ensure they execute tasks correctly."
    },
    {
      "step": 4,
      "name": "Learn",
      "description": "Agentic AI continuously improves through a feedback loop, or “data flywheel,” where the data generated from its interactions is fed into the system to enhance models. This ability to adapt and become more effective over time offers businesses a powerful tool for driving better decision-making and operational efficiency."

  "hindi_explanation": "एजेंटिक एआई (Agentic AI) एक प्रकार की कृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता है जो स्वायत्त रूप से (बिना निरंतर मानव हस्तक्षेप के) लक्ष्यों को प्राप्त करने के लिए निर्णय ले सकती है और कार्य कर सकती है। यह एआई सिस्टम केवल इनपुट-आउटपुट मशीन नहीं होती, बल्कि यह स्वयं उद्देश्यों को समझने, योजना बनाने, स्मृति का उपयोग करने और बाहरी टूल्स या वातावरण से बातचीत करने में सक्षम होती है। उदाहरण के रूप में AutoGPT, BabyAGI, और Voyager जैसे एजेंटिक एआई सिस्टम्स ने यह दिखाया है कि कैसे मशीनें जटिल कार्यों को चरणबद्ध ढंग से पूरा कर सकती हैं। हालांकि, इसके साथ कुछ चुनौतियां भी जुडी हैं, जैसे कि लक्ष्यों का गलत निर्धारण, निर्णयों में पारदर्शिता की कमी, और सुरक्षा संबंधी जोखिम। इसलिए, एजेंटिक एआई का विकास करते समय नैतिकता, पारदर्शिता और मानव नियंत्रण को प्राथमिकता देना आवश्यक है।"
